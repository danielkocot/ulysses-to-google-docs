Stylesheet to export Ulysses to Google Docs

# How to use

Ulysses is great for Markdown, but there's no great way to export from Ulysses to Google Docs.

Copying and pasting as rich text ends up losing styles. Use this stylesheet to retain Google Docs default styles when copy and pasting HTML from Ulysses.

1. Import this Stylesheet into Ulysses.
2. Export your Ulysses document as HTML, using the "Google Docs" stylesheet
3. Copy and paste into Google Docs
